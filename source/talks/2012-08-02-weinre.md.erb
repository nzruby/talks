From [the website](http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/):

> [weinre](http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/) is a debugger for web pages, like FireBug (for FireFox) and Web Inspector (for WebKit-based browsers), except it's designed to work remotely, and in particular, to allow you debug web pages on a mobile device such as a phone.

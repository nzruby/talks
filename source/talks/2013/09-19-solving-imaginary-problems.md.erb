title: Solving Imaginary Problems
layout: talk
author: Daniel Fone
venue: Christchurch Ruby
intro:
  Using TDD to solve an (non-trivial but pointless) interview-style problem, while rolling our own test framework.
---

The interview question:

```ruby
def f(n)
  # define f so that f(f(n)) == -n
end
```

Approach to solving:

1. Define problem…
2. … with tests
3. Write the code we wish we had
4. Implement that code, quick and dirty
5. Tests passing? Refactor!

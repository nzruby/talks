Want to learn how to punch ducks, patch monkeys and override the wishes and best intents of other programmers?

This talk runs very quickly through the basics of metaprogramming using the Ruby programming language.
I'll be sure to mention the why, the how, the advantages, and some common pitfalls.

I'll talk about the basic Ruby concepts:

* instance_eval
* `module_eval`
* `class_eval`
* eval
* send
* include
* extend
* prepend
* define_method
* method_missing

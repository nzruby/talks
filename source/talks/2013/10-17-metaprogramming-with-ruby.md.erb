---

*This upcoming talk will be given on October 17th at [Newbie Night](http://christchurch.ruby.org.nz/).*

Want to learn how to punch ducks, patch monkeys and override the wishes and best intents of other programmers?

This talk will quickly run through the basics of metaprogramming using the Ruby programming language.
I'll be sure to mention the advantages and also the common pitfalls.

I'll talk about the basic Ruby concepts:

* `module_eval`
* `class_eval`

And Rails concepts:

* `alias_method_chain`

If we get enough time then I'll cover:

* [Pry](https://github.com/pry/pry)
* [Refinements](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/doc/syntax/refinements_rdoc.html)

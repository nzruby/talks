*This upcoming talk will be given on October 17th at [Newbie Night](http://christchurch.ruby.org.nz/).*

I remember when I was first switching from PHP to Rails, a huge appeal was how quickly you could prototype things. So…

*Quick and Dirty Rails*

* 10–15 minute prototype of a real-world application.
* Scaffold driven
* Dev only setup, sqlite etc
* No tests.

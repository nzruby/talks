intro: An introduction to Metaprogramming with Ruby.
---

Want to learn how to punch ducks, patch monkeys and override the wishes and best intents of other programmers?

This talk will quickly run through the basics of metaprogramming using the Ruby programming language.
I'll be sure to mention the advantages and also the common pitfalls.

I'll talk about the basic Ruby concepts:

* module_eval
* class_eval

And Rails concepts:

* alias_method_chain

If we get enough time then I'll cover:

* pry
* refinements
